- Limit orderbook completeness with order-level specificity (Not only price and volume but actual order queues).
- Order-Driven modeling with Market Events definitions, e.g. New Market Order, Cancel Limit Order, etc.
- Stochastic process generators for rich/complex simulations (Brownian, Hawkes, etc).
